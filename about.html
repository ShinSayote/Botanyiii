    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Botanyiii is founded by Janpaul Zamora a Grade 10 student in New Era University Lipa City Branch. Botanyiii is a nature-centric agricultural company focused on sustainable and organic farming. We aim to bring green solutions to everyday cultivation needs.</p>
    <p>Our journey started with a simple idea: to provide accessible, eco-friendly farming alternatives to help people reconnect with nature. Whether you’re an urban gardener or a rural farmer, our products are designed to make your cultivation process healthier and more rewarding.</p>
    <p>We believe in transparency, quality, and community. Our team works closely with local farmers and environmental experts to ensure that every item we offer meets the highest standards of sustainability and effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Let’s grow together—naturally.</p>
